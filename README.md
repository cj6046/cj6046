# Introduction

Hey! Iâ€™m Chris, a senior at Auburn University studying Computer Science while working full time as a Software Engineer with Gridline in Atlanta. My first Bachelor's degree is also from Auburn University, where I studied Theatre and Performance. Next came several good years of acting professionally around the greater Atlanta area. With the Covid-19 pandemic, live theatre halted abrudptly. While sad, this gave me a chance to revitalize my love and passion for science and computing. This year, I am hoping to deepen my understanding in a few key areas (Web Infrastructure, A.I., and Machine Learning in particular) and broaden my knowledge overall.

# Currently Learning

- As I pursue my degree, I am learning a broad array of topics such as machine learning with Python, low-level assembly, and networking. 
- In my professional capacity, I am earning a deep knowledge of API development and AWS services (serverless lambdas in particular). 
- Finally, on my own, I am currently studying web infrastructure with terraform, building/training my own AI tools, and startup business practices.

# Main Interests

I love building things that help improve people's lives, whether that is simply saving time or fostering a more equitable and accessible world. Inspired by trailblazers like Sal Khan and Luis von Ahn, who have revolutionized education through technology, I'm committed to leveraging artificial intelligence and complementary technologies to further these goals. My focus lies in mastering the tools necessary to bring AI-driven products to fruition, fueld by a vision of a more inclusive and empowered future.

## Secondary Interests and Hobbies

- Video Game Design, where my theatrical storytelling background meets my analytical mind!
- Writing, both poetry and prose
- History, because my nerdiness cannot be contained in computers
