# Introduction

Hey! Iâ€™m Chris, a Sophomore at Georgia State Perimeter College studying Computer Science looking for my first professional co-op. My first Bachelor's degree is from 
Auburn University, where I studied Theatre and Performance. Next came several good years of acting professionally around the greater Atlanta area. With the Covid-19 
pandemic, live theatre halted abrudptly. While sad, this gave me a chance to revitalize my love and passion for science and computing. Next year, I am hoping 
to transfer to a 4-year institution where I can deepen my understand in a few key areas (A.I. and Machine Learning in particular) and broaden my knowledge overall.

# Currently Learning

Currently, I am in Computer Science II and primarily learning Java in class (while teaching myself C++ on the side). However, I've had experience with C#, HTML, 
CSS, and Python as well. Obviously, I cannot post my class projects here due to plagiarism issues, but I am trying to upload as many personal projects as I 
can while working and taking a full course load! Please forgive the lack of repos... 

# Main Interests

Autonomity in robotics is my main area of interest. I really want to get involved in self-driving cars, autonomous UAV's, or self-mobilizing robots such as 
those developed at Boston Dynamics. Embedded systems are a second area of interest (and giving those systems the ability to learn on their own!). The Internet of Things 
is ever expanding and I would love to be a part of it. I can't wait to learn more, especially in professional settings!

## Secondary Interests and Hobbies

- Video Game Design, where my theatrical storytelling background meets my analytical mind!
- Writing, both poetry and prose
- History, because my nerdiness cannot be contained in computers

# Contact Info

The best way to get me (that I'm willing to post on such a public forum) is my LinkedIn profile:


There, you can look at my resume, see more of my relevant skills and experience, or just message me about potential collaboration. I'd love to help and learn 
along the way!
