# Introduction

Hey! Iâ€™m Chris, a rising junior who just transferred to the University of Central Florida to study Computer Science while working full time as a Software Engineer I with ServiceMaster. My first Bachelor's degree is from Auburn University, where I studied Theatre and Performance. Next came several good years of acting professionally around the greater Atlanta area. With the Covid-19 pandemic, live theatre halted abrudptly. While sad, this gave me a chance to revitalize my love and passion for science and computing. This year, I am hoping to deepen my understanding in a few key areas (A.I. and Machine Learning in particular) and broaden my knowledge overall.

# Currently Learning

While I have mainly been taught Java in class, my pursuit of knowledge doesn't end at the bell. I have been teaching myself Python and C++ for machine learning and robotics, but also Javascript for full-stack web applications using frameworks such as React and Django. Obviously, I cannot post my class projects here due to plagiarism issues, but I am trying to upload as many personal projects as I can in between classes to show off my self-taught skills.

# Main Interests

Intelligent computing is my main area of interest. Whether that is NLP systems, self-driving cars, or self-mobilizing robots such as those developed at Boston Dynamics, I love it all. Embedded systems are a second area of interest (and giving those systems the ability to learn on their own!). The Internet of Things is ever expanding and I am going to be a part of it. I can't wait to learn more, especially in professional settings!

## Secondary Interests and Hobbies

- Video Game Design, where my theatrical storytelling background meets my analytical mind!
- Writing, both poetry and prose
- History, because my nerdiness cannot be contained in computers
